      <p style="font-size:11px;font-weight:700;color:var(--muted);letter-spacing:.1em;text-transform:uppercase;margin-bottom:32px;">February 25, 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; By Kristina, Founder &amp; CEO</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Charter school enrollment is not a marketing problem. It is a systems problem. The schools that consistently fill their seats — and fill them early — are not the ones with the largest advertising budgets. They are the ones that treat enrollment as a structured, year-round process with clear stages, consistent touchpoints, and real accountability to metrics.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">This guide focuses specifically on what works for founding and pre-opening charter schools — schools that are trying to build family interest before they have a track record, a building, or a single enrolled student to point to.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:28px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:36px 0 16px;">Start Earlier Than You Think You Need To</h2>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">The most common enrollment mistake founding charter schools make is starting their outreach too late. If you plan to open in August, your community visibility campaign should begin no later than the previous fall — ideally 12 to 14 months before opening. Families in most markets make school decisions in winter and spring. If you are not in their consideration set before February, you will be chasing late-deciding families for the rest of your first enrollment cycle.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">What does an early campaign look like in practice? It is not social media posts. It is strategic community presence — introducing your school to the right people in the right places before you are asking anyone to enroll. It is having your founding leader show up at community events, faith institutions, neighborhood associations, and family-facing organizations in your target area. It is generating interest you can capture in a waitlist long before your official application opens.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:28px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:36px 0 16px;">Build a Waitlist Before You Need It</h2>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">A waitlist is not just a buffer for your lottery. It is a signal — to your community, to your authorizer, and to your founding families — that your school has real demand. We have helped charter schools generate 350+ family expressions of interest in 60 days and 400+ intent-to-enroll forms in 30 days by treating waitlist building as a structured campaign, not a passive outcome.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Your waitlist campaign needs three things: a simple interest form (not a full application), a follow-up sequence that converts interested families into committed families, and a system for tracking where every family is in that process. Without the tracking, you cannot follow up efficiently. Without the follow-up, interest dissipates.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:28px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:36px 0 16px;">Make Your Founding Families Your Best Marketers</h2>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">The most powerful enrollment marketing tool available to a founding charter school is its founding families. Parents who are genuinely excited about your school will tell other parents. They will share your information in group chats, at school pickup, at church, at community events. Word of mouth from a trusted peer is more powerful than any campaign you can design.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Founding family programs are structured ways to mobilize this asset. They give your earliest enrolling families a role — ambassador, advocate, founding member — and specific tools to help them share your school with their networks. Yard signs with the school brand. Referral tracking. Recognition at events. A sense that they are part of building something real, not just enrolling in it.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">We have seen founding family programs generate more qualified family interest than paid campaigns at a fraction of the cost. Invest in mobilizing the families you already have before you spend money trying to find new ones.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:28px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:36px 0 16px;">Open Houses Are a Conversion Tool, Not an Awareness Tool</h2>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Most founding charter schools treat open houses as their primary marketing event — the place where they introduce themselves to the community. This is the wrong frame. An open house is a conversion tool. It should be designed to convert families who are already aware of and interested in your school into families who are ready to apply.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">That means your pre-event outreach is more important than the event itself. Who are you inviting, and why will they come? What is the specific call to action at the event — not just "learn more," but "complete your application tonight"? What happens in the 48 hours after the event to follow up with everyone who attended but did not apply on the spot?</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">We have seen schools boost open house attendance by more than 40% by changing how they invite families — shifting from generic social media posts to targeted, personal outreach through community networks. Post-event conversion rates improve dramatically when the follow-up sequence is designed before the event, not after.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:28px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:36px 0 16px;">Text Families, Not Just Email</h2>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Email open rates for school communications hover around 20 to 25 percent. SMS open rates are consistently above 95 percent. Families who have not opened your last three enrollment reminder emails will often respond to a text within minutes. If you are not texting your pipeline, you are leaving a significant amount of follow-up effectiveness on the table.</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Mass texting does not require a large budget. It requires a clear message, a specific ask, and a system for tracking responses. Pre-built templates for your lottery reminder, your open house invitation, your missing documents follow-up, and your enrollment deadline create a consistent, professional communication cadence that keeps families engaged through the full enrollment cycle.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:28px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:36px 0 16px;">Think in Metrics, Not Vibes</h2>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">The founding charter schools that consistently succeed at enrollment share one characteristic: they track everything. How many families are in the inquiry stage? How many have submitted an application? How many are missing documents? What percentage of families who attended an open house converted to applicants? What is the average time between inquiry and application submission?</p>

      <p style="font-size:17px;color:var(--muted);line-height:1.8;margin-bottom:24px;">Without these numbers, you cannot identify where families are dropping off in your pipeline — and you cannot fix the problem. With them, you can identify exactly which stage needs work and deploy the right intervention: a text campaign, a document reminder, a personal call, an additional open house.</p>
