      <p style="font-size:19px;color:var(--text);font-weight:500;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:28px;">The single biggest mistake founding charter schools make is treating enrollment like it starts when the application window opens. By then, you're already behind. The schools that open full — or close to it — start building enrollment momentum 12 to 18 months before opening day.</p>

      <p>Here's how that actually works in practice.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">Why Pre-Opening Enrollment Is Different</h2>
      <p>When families enroll their child in a school that doesn't exist yet, they're making a trust decision. They can't tour the building. They haven't met the teachers. The school has no reputation, no report card, no word of mouth yet. They're enrolling based entirely on your story, your brand, and their belief that you're going to deliver what you've promised.</p>
      <p>That means pre-opening enrollment is fundamentally a visibility and trust-building exercise — not an admissions campaign. You're not just trying to collect applications. You're trying to build a community of families who believe in your school before it exists.</p>
      <p>The schools that do this well generate 300–500 family contacts in the year before opening. The ones that wait until their application window to start outreach scramble to fill seats and often open under-enrolled — which creates a financial and operational crisis in Year 1 that's very hard to recover from.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">The Pre-Opening Enrollment Sequence</h2>
      <p>What we've found works — across schools in Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas — is a sequenced approach that builds momentum in phases rather than trying to generate enrollment in a single campaign.</p>

      <div style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:4px;margin:24px 0;">
        <div style="display:flex;gap:20px;align-items:flex-start;padding:20px 24px;background:var(--offwhite);border-radius:12px 12px 0 0;border:1px solid var(--border);">
          <div style="width:40px;height:40px;background:var(--navy);border-radius:50%;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;color:#fff;font-weight:700;font-size:15px;flex-shrink:0;">1</div>
          <div>
            <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:6px;">Build Your Interest List (12–18 months out)</div>
            <p style="font-size:14px;margin:0;">Before you have an application, before you have a launch date, before your website is finished — you need an interest list. Create a simple landing page or form that captures names and emails. Every community interaction, every conversation, every social media post should point to that form. The goal is to build a pool of families who have self-identified as interested. This is your founding community.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;gap:20px;align-items:flex-start;padding:20px 24px;background:var(--offwhite);border:1px solid var(--border);border-top:none;">
          <div style="width:40px;height:40px;background:var(--teal);border-radius:50%;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;color:#fff;font-weight:700;font-size:15px;flex-shrink:0;">2</div>
          <div>
            <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:6px;">Activate Founder Families (9–12 months out)</div>
            <p style="font-size:14px;margin:0;">Founder families are your early adopters — the families who are truly committed to your school's vision and willing to be visible about it in their community. They become ambassadors. They share your posts, put yard signs in front of their homes, talk about your school at their church, their barbershop, their kid's soccer practice. Identifying and activating 20–30 founder families early creates the social proof that makes other families feel safe trusting you.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;gap:20px;align-items:flex-start;padding:20px 24px;background:var(--offwhite);border:1px solid var(--border);border-top:none;">
          <div style="width:40px;height:40px;background:var(--orange);border-radius:50%;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;color:#fff;font-weight:700;font-size:15px;flex-shrink:0;">3</div>
          <div>
            <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:6px;">Run Community Visibility Campaigns (6–9 months out)</div>
            <p style="font-size:14px;margin:0;">By this stage, you need to be visible in the physical spaces where your target families spend time. That means community events, partnerships with local organizations, a presence at school fairs, flyers at daycares and pediatrician offices, and a social media presence that's showing up consistently. This isn't about going viral — it's about being present enough in your community that families who are looking for school options find you.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;gap:20px;align-items:flex-start;padding:20px 24px;background:var(--offwhite);border:1px solid var(--border);border-top:none;">
          <div style="width:40px;height:40px;background:var(--navy);border-radius:50%;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;color:#fff;font-weight:700;font-size:15px;flex-shrink:0;">4</div>
          <div>
            <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:6px;">Convert Interest to Intent-to-Enroll (3–6 months out)</div>
            <p style="font-size:14px;margin:0;">Intent-to-enroll forms are not applications. They're a low-commitment step that moves families from "I'm interested" to "I'm planning to apply." They also give you real data on how many families are seriously considering your school — which matters for your lottery planning, your facility sizing, and your board conversations about opening year projections.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;gap:20px;align-items:flex-start;padding:20px 24px;background:var(--offwhite);border-radius:0 0 12px 12px;border:1px solid var(--border);border-top:none;">
          <div style="width:40px;height:40px;background:var(--teal);border-radius:50%;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;color:#fff;font-weight:700;font-size:15px;flex-shrink:0;">5</div>
          <div>
            <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:6px;">Open Application Window with a Full Pipeline</div>
            <p style="font-size:14px;margin:0;">When your application window opens, you want to have a warm list of families who already know you, trust you, and are expecting to apply. You're not introducing yourself — you're reminding families to complete what they've already said they want to do. This is the difference between a school that hits capacity in its first lottery and one that scrambles to fill seats through June.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">The Numbers That Tell You If It's Working</h2>
      <p>Here's what strong pre-opening enrollment looks like in practice. Twelve months before opening, you want 150–300 families on your interest list. Six months before opening, you want 50–100 families who have submitted intent-to-enroll forms. Three months before opening, your application window should generate enough applications to run a real lottery — ideally 1.5 to 2x your available seats.</p>
      <p>Schools that hit those benchmarks open at or near capacity. Schools that don't are scrambling until September.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">What Founding Charter Schools Actually Struggle With</h2>
      <p>Most founding teams know they need to do enrollment outreach. The challenge isn't awareness — it's execution. Building visibility while simultaneously writing a charter petition, hiring staff, securing a facility, and managing a board is genuinely difficult. Enrollment gets deprioritized until it's urgent.</p>
      <p>That's why having a system — a structured enrollment calendar with clear milestones, assigned responsibilities, and tracked metrics — matters so much. Enrollment that happens reactively rarely reaches the numbers a founding school needs. Enrollment that's built systematically, over 12–18 months, almost always does.</p>
