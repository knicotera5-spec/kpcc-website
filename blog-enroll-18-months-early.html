  <p>Most charter founders believe enrollment starts after approval.</p>

  <p>Get the letter. Celebrate. Exhale. Then start talking to families.</p>

  <p>It makes sense on the surface. You can't enroll students in a school that doesn't officially exist yet. So you wait until the paperwork clears, and then you build.</p>

  <p>The problem is that by the time most founders start building, the schools that will open fully enrolled are already 12 months in.</p>

  <p>I've worked with charter schools across Georgia and the Southeast at every stage of the process. And the single biggest predictor of whether a school opens with 120 students or 60 isn't the mission, the curriculum, or even the location.</p>

  <p>It's when they started.</p>

  <blockquote>"The families you need on opening day are making decisions right now. Someone else is building a relationship with them while you wait."</blockquote>

  <h2>The Two Schools</h2>

  <p>Let me show you what this actually looks like.</p>

  <p><strong>School A</strong> submitted their application and immediately started building. While their petition was under review, they were collecting interest forms. They hosted community listening sessions. They built a founder family list. They created a simple email sequence that went out every two weeks &mdash; not selling, just sharing the vision and inviting people to follow along.</p>

  <p>By the time approval came through, they had 200 families who already knew who they were. They had 40 founder families who had told their neighbors. They had a pipeline, a list, and a community.</p>

  <p>Lottery day was a formality. They had more applicants than seats.</p>

  <p><strong>School B</strong> got approved and then started thinking about enrollment. They built a website. They designed a flyer. They posted on social media. They worked hard.</p>

  <p>They opened with 67 students in a building designed for 120.</p>

  <p>Both schools had good missions. Both had dedicated founders. One had a system that started early. One didn't.</p>

  <h2>Why Starting Early Actually Works</h2>

  <p>There's a psychological principle at work here that most enrollment strategies ignore.</p>

  <p>Families don't make school decisions quickly. They research, consider, talk to other parents, and then decide. The average family takes 3 to 6 months from first awareness to application. Which means if you want families to be ready to apply when your lottery opens, they need to know about you 3 to 6 months before that.</p>

  <p>And if you want them to trust you enough to choose you over an established school &mdash; one with a track record, a building they can see, and parents they can talk to &mdash; you need even more time.</p>

  <p>You're asking families to take a leap of faith. The longer you've been in their world, the smaller that leap feels.</p>

  <p>This is why the schools that open fully enrolled almost always start visibility work 12 to 18 months before their doors open. Not because they're more resourced. Because they understand how family decision-making actually works.</p>

  <h2>What 12&ndash;18 Months Out Actually Looks Like</h2>

  <p>Starting early doesn't mean launching a full marketing campaign before you have approval. It means doing the groundwork that makes everything else work when the time comes.</p>

  <div class="timeline-block">
    <h3>12&ndash;18 Months Out: Build Awareness and Collect Interest</h3>
    <p>This is the quiet phase. You're not selling anything. You're introducing yourself. Host 2&ndash;3 community listening sessions. Create a simple interest form &mdash; name, email, zip code, number of school-age children. Start showing up in the community: farmers markets, church announcements, neighborhood association meetings. Begin posting consistently about your vision. The goal at this stage is not applications. It's awareness and trust.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="timeline-block">
    <h3>9&ndash;12 Months Out: Activate Your Founder Families</h3>
    <p>By now you should have a list of families who have expressed interest. Identify your first 20&ndash;40 founder families and treat them differently. They get personal communication, early access to information, and a sense of ownership in what you're building. Give them tools to spread the word &mdash; yard signs, digital graphics, language they can use when friends ask about your school. Host a founder family event. Peer trust converts at a higher rate than any ad you'll ever run.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="timeline-block">
    <h3>6&ndash;9 Months Out: Launch Your Formal Enrollment Campaign</h3>
    <p>Now you start talking about enrollment directly. Announce your lottery opening date and start the countdown. Increase your posting frequency and mix in content that answers the questions families are already asking. Start an email sequence that nurtures families from interest to application. Host your first formal open house with a clear registration and follow-up system.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="timeline-block">
    <h3>3&ndash;6 Months Out: Convert and Follow Up</h3>
    <p>This is the phase where most schools start. For schools that started early, this is where the work pays off. Your lottery is open. You have a warm list. Your job now is follow-up &mdash; consistent, personal, relentless. Text families who haven't completed their application. Host a second open house for families still deciding. Close the loop with your founder families. Their neighbors should be hearing about you right now.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>The 90-Day Action Plan for Right Now</h2>

  <p>Whether you're pre-petition or just approved, here's what you can do in the next 90 days to start building the pipeline that leads to a full enrollment.</p>

  <div class="action-box">
    <h3>Days 1&ndash;30: Set Up Your Foundation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create or update your interest form and make sure it's easy to find</li>
      <li>Start collecting contacts everywhere you go &mdash; in person and online</li>
      <li>Post on social media at least 3 times per week about your vision, community, and mission</li>
      <li>Identify 5 people in your community who believe in what you're building and ask them to be founding ambassadors</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="action-box">
    <h3>Days 31&ndash;60: Start Showing Up</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Host one community listening session or info session</li>
      <li>Launch a simple email newsletter &mdash; even once a month is better than nothing</li>
      <li>Create a founder family experience and invite your first 10&ndash;20 families into it</li>
      <li>Make a list of every community organization, church, and neighborhood group in your target area &mdash; and start attending</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="action-box">
    <h3>Days 61&ndash;90: Build Momentum</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Review your list and segment it &mdash; who is ready to apply, who needs more nurturing, who is just curious</li>
      <li>Set up a basic follow-up system so no one falls through the cracks</li>
      <li>Host another event and track who shows up</li>
      <li>Set your lottery date and announce it publicly</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>This is the work that doesn't feel like enrollment marketing. But it's what fills seats.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

  <p>The families you need on opening day are making decisions right now. They're evaluating schools, talking to neighbors, and forming impressions.</p>

  <p>If your school is in their world, you have a chance. If it isn't, you don't.</p>

  <p>Starting early isn't about doing more work. It's about doing the right work at the right time so that when your lottery opens, you have a community ready &mdash; not a blank slate.</p>

  <p>The best time to start was 12 months ago. The second best time is today.</p>
