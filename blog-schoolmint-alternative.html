      <p style="font-size:19px;color:var(--text);font-weight:500;line-height:1.7;margin-bottom:28px;">Every charter school founder eventually hits the same wall. You've been approved. Families are asking how to enroll. Your team is tracking applications in a spreadsheet that's already falling apart. And someone says: "Have you looked at SchoolMint?"</p>

      <p>Then you look at SchoolMint's pricing.</p>
      <p>$5,000 to $15,000 per year — for a system that was built for districts and established networks, not for a founding charter school with 100 families in your pipeline and a board that's watching every dollar.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">The SchoolMint Problem for Founding Schools</h2>
      <p>SchoolMint is a legitimate product. For large charter networks and district-wide programs managing thousands of applications annually, it makes sense. The problem is that it wasn't designed for the stage most of its new customers are actually at.</p>
      <p>Founding charter schools — typically in Year 0 through Year 2 — don't need a district-grade SIS platform with 50 features they'll never use. They need four things:</p>
      <ul style="margin:16px 0 16px 24px;display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:8px;">
        <li>A way to capture and organize family interest and applications</li>
        <li>A lottery system that's compliant and easy to run</li>
        <li>A way to communicate with families at scale — mass texting, email</li>
        <li>A clean view of where every family is in the process</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SchoolMint does all of that — and 40 other things you don't need yet — for a price that's genuinely prohibitive for pre-revenue schools that haven't enrolled their first student.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">What Most Founding Schools Actually Do Instead</h2>
      <p>When SchoolMint is too expensive, founding schools typically fall back on one of three options:</p>

      <div style="background:var(--offwhite);border-radius:12px;padding:24px 28px;margin:20px 0;border-left:4px solid var(--orange);">
        <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:8px;">Option 1: Google Sheets or Airtable</div>
        <p style="margin:0;">Free, flexible, and completely unscalable past 50 families. No lottery functionality. No mass texting. No duplicate detection. Every update is manual. Every report is a pivot table nightmare. This is where most founding schools start — and where they stay too long.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="background:var(--offwhite);border-radius:12px;padding:24px 28px;margin:20px 0;border-left:4px solid var(--teal);">
        <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:8px;">Option 2: Cognito Forms or JotForm Alone</div>
        <p style="margin:0;">Good for collecting applications. Terrible for managing what happens after. You get a spreadsheet export and a pile of form submissions. There's no pipeline view, no lottery tool, no family communication layer.</p>
      </div>
      <div style="background:var(--offwhite);border-radius:12px;padding:24px 28px;margin:20px 0;border-left:4px solid var(--navy);">
        <div style="font-weight:700;color:var(--navy);margin-bottom:8px;">Option 3: Paying for SchoolMint and Resenting Every Invoice</div>
        <p style="margin:0;">Real. We hear this from schools all the time. They pay for it because they feel like they have to, they use 20% of the features, and they can't wait to find something else.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">What a SchoolMint Alternative for Founding Charter Schools Should Actually Include</h2>
      <p>Before recommending anything, here's the honest checklist of what a founding charter school's enrollment management system needs to do:</p>
      <ul style="margin:16px 0 24px 24px;display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px;">
        <li><strong>Application intake</strong> — Collect applications from families in a structured, organized way</li>
        <li><strong>Pipeline tracking</strong> — See every family by stage: inquiry, application started, application complete, waitlisted, enrolled</li>
        <li><strong>Lottery system</strong> — Run a compliant, randomized lottery with preference categories (sibling priority, geographic preference, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Mass communication</strong> — Send texts and emails to your full list or specific segments without exporting to another tool</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicate detection</strong> — Know when the same family has submitted multiple times so you're not managing inflated numbers</li>
        <li><strong>SIS import/export</strong> — When you're ready to move student data into your SIS, it needs to be clean and formatted correctly</li>
        <li><strong>Affordability</strong> — It needs to cost what a founding school can actually pay</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">Why We Built Enroll</h2>
      <p>After working with founding charter schools across Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas, we kept watching the same thing happen: strong schools with real community support were drowning in enrollment operations because the tools available were either too simple or too expensive.</p>
      <p>Enroll is the platform we built to solve that specific problem. It's not a SchoolMint replacement for a 50-school network. It's a founding school enrollment system that does exactly what founding schools need — and nothing they don't.</p>
      <p>It includes a Cognito Forms integration for application intake, a full pipeline dashboard, a built-in lottery system, mass SMS texting to families, CSV import and export for SIS compatibility, and duplicate family detection. It's built specifically for charter schools in Year 0 through Year 3, at a price point that doesn't require a board vote to approve.</p>

      <div style="background:var(--navy);border-radius:16px;padding:32px 40px;margin:40px 0;text-align:center;">
        <h3 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:22px;font-weight:900;color:#fff;margin-bottom:12px;">Enroll Is Currently in Beta</h3>
        <p style="font-size:15px;color:rgba(255,255,255,.65);margin-bottom:24px;">We're accepting founding charter schools for beta access now. Beta schools get direct support from our team during onboarding and input into the product roadmap.</p>

      <h2 style="font-family:var(--font-serif);font-size:26px;font-weight:900;color:var(--navy);margin:40px 0 16px;">The Bottom Line on SchoolMint Alternatives</h2>
      <p>If you're a founding charter school evaluating enrollment management software, the most important question isn't which platform has the most features. It's which platform was built for your stage.</p>
      <p>SchoolMint is built for scale. Google Sheets is built for simplicity. What founding charter schools need is something in between — a purpose-built system that handles your real enrollment challenges without charging you for infrastructure you won't need for three years.</p>
      <p>That's what Enroll is. And if you're currently running enrollment out of a spreadsheet, it was built specifically for you.</p>
